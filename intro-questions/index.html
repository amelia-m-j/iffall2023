        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>

        <p>1. My name is Amelia Johnson. I'm a junior studying communication design and psychology.</p>
        <p>2. This is a required class for my major, but I've been wanting to take it aynway after seeing some friends produce some great work in it!</p>
        <p>3. I do not have any experience with HTML or CSS, but I did take an intro java course last year.</p>
        <p>4. I hope to learn the basics of web developement and the resources I can turn to to build on that foundation in the future.</p>
        <p>5. I think designing for screen at my level of experience will create certain limitations that I will have to work within, but that often leads to the most interesting design solutions.</p>
        <p>6. <a href = "https://ohnotype.co/">Oh no Type Co</a> has a beautiful website. It's simple and easy to navigate, but uses layout to create a sort of chaotic feeling that exemplifies their brand. It's use of typography is aso working well without distracting from the typographic elements it's actually trying to sell.</p>
        <p>7. <a href = "https://harrysdesigns.com/ILLUSTRATION-AND-MOTION" title = "harrysdesigns">Harrys Designs</a> uses a brutalist appraoch which makes it clear and easy to navigate, while the personal touches of illustrated animation throughout set a friendly tone.</p>
        <p>8. <a href = "http://someallnone.com/showcase/">Some All None</a> has such a fun and playful landing page that perfectly exemplifies the artist's body of work. It sets the tone for the viewer's entire experience on the site. I also like the way each image temporarily interacts with the next in the transitions on the showcase page.</p>
