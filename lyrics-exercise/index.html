        <br>
        <p>Weird Al: Well, the sun is still high in the afternoon sky, but the morning seems 
        so long ago. I was happy before and I'm not anymore, though why there's a change,
        I don't know.</p>
        <p>Kate: I'm so tired of this day, and I don't want to play, and I don't want a story to read. But I look in your eyes, and at once realize, that I know what it is-</p>
        <p>Weird Al: Yes I know what it is</p>
        <p>Both: Now I know what it is that I need... I need a nap!</p>
        <p>Kate: I just can't take anymore</p>
        <p>Both: I need a nap!</p>
        <p>Weird Al: Can't stay awake anymore</p>
        <p>Both: No more running around I just need to lie down and sleep.</p>
        <p>Weird Al: I don't know what to do, I just canâ€™t make it through, I want something or nothing right now.</p>
        <p>Kate: I am mad and upset. What I want I don't get. I don't know what I want, anyhow.</p>
        <p>Weird Al: I've been doing my best, now I just want to rest. On the rug, on the floor, I don't care.</p>
        <p>Kate: Now the feeling's so strong, but this song is too long, it's the wrong kind of song and it seems to be going nowhere.</p>
        <p>Both: Nowhere! Oh, I need a nap! I just can't take anymore! I need a nap!
            Can't stay awake anymore! No more running around I just need to lie down and
            sleep. Let me sleep! There are times in the day when the going gets tough. When
            you just have to say you've done more than enough.</p>
        <p>Weird Al: I can't think of more stuff that will rhyme with enough.</p>
        <p>Both: So enough is enough. Is enough is enough. Is enough is enough is
            enough is enough is enough is enough is-- I need a nap!</p>
        <p>Weird Al: Why does this song go on?</p>
        <p>Both: I need a nap!</p>
        <p>Weird Al: When all my strength is gone?</p>
        <p>Both: I need a nap!</p>
        <p>Kate: Please let me close my eyes.</p>
        <p>Both: I need a nap! I don't wanna-- harmonize-- with you-- with me-</p>
        <p>Weird Al: Change key!! </p>
        <p>(Kate: Make him stop!!)</p>
        <p>Both: I need a nap! I just can't take anymore. I need a nap!</p>
        <p>Weird Al: Can't stay awake anymore!! (Kate: Aaaugh!)</p>
        <p>Both: You can follow my lead as this song loses speed, now I need an immediate nap!</p>
