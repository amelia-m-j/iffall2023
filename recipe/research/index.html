    <h1>Chile Relleno</h1>

    <h2>Recipe Content</h2>
    <p>Chile rellenos are a New Mexican specialty. They're breaded and fried chiles stuffed with cheese and topped with red or green chile sauce.</p>
    <p>Ingredients:
        12 ounces (about 3 cups) shredded cheese (preferably Monterey jack cheese or asadero, shredded), 12 whole roasted large New Mexican green chiles (slit from end to end), 6 large eggs (separated), ½ cup all-purpose flour, ¾ teaspoon salt, Vegetable oil or shortening for deep frying, 1 cup all-purpose flour, Green Chile Sauce (warmed)</p>
    <p>Directions: <br>
        1. With your fingers, stuff each chile with cheese, filling them well but not to overflowing <br>
        2. Preheat oven to 400 <br>
        3. To prepare the batter, beat the egg whites in a large bowl with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Mix in the egg yolks, the ½ cup flour, and salt, beating only until combined. Note the batter should be lightly stiff and thick enough to coat the chiles. <br>
        4. Heat 4 inches of oil in a large heavy pan to 350° F. Place a baking rack over a few thicknesses of paper towels within easy reach of the stovetop <br>
        5. Pour 1 cup of flour out on a plate. Lay the first chile, seam-side up, in the flour to coat, using a spoon to cover it thoroughly.<br>
        6. Dunk the chile into the batter, seam-side up, and spoon more batter over it. When evenly coated, pull it from the batter by its stem and let any excess batter drip back into the bowl. No cheese should show—the batter should be thick enough to seal the chile's slit.<br>
        7. Slip the chile into the oil and repeat with the remaining chiles as you have room in the pan.<br>
        8. Fry the chiles for about 4 to 5 minutes, turning as needed to fry them until evenly golden and crisp. Drain the chiles on the baking rack.<br>
        9. Transfer the chiles to a heatproof platter or individual plates, then top with chile sauce and cheese. Pop in the oven for about 3 minutes, until the cheese on top has melted. Serve immediately.</p>

    <h2>Recipe Websites</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.finedininglovers.com/recipes/main-course/pasta-tomato-stockfish-seaweed-smoked-pepper">Finedining Lovers</a> <br>
    This website is very nevigable. I like the way it breaks the recipe down into sections (ingredients, method, etc.) and establishes heirarchy between them. The minimalist color scheme and use of white space also make it feel very elegant.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/223400/old-school-mac-n-cheese/">Allrecipes</a><br>
    On the other hand, this website has a lot more going on, less white space and more photos and videos. It's clearly targetted towards a different audience and it feels more appraochable for a novice cook.</p>

    The lack of photos on this website makes me less interested in actually making the recipe. however, I appreciate it's simple and straightforward approach. The use of type pairings to create heirarchy, reinforced by scale and color, is working nicely.</p>

    <h2>Non-Recipe Websites</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/">Barnes & Nbole</a><br>
    Similarly to recipe websites, book sellers have to convey a lot of information in an orderly way. I like the way this website breaks up that information and even hides some of it in tabs that you have to click between. Heirarchy can be established using typography and layout, but it can also be established through interaction design choices.</p>
    <p><a href="https://fontsinuse.com/">Fonts In Use</a><br>
    This is a good example of a photo forward website. I like the use of the two, uneven columns which establish the text as support of the photographs. In a recipe website, this same technique could be used to either really emphasize the imagery of the recipe, or be reversed to emphasize the text and use images as support.</p>
    <p><a href="https://socialspecies-studio.com/">Social Species</a><br>
    This website is pretty straightforward but has so much personality. I especially like the use of motion graphics. The grid it establishes is really strong and the fact that it differs between photographs and text makes for an especially dynamic composition.</p>
